# Getting Started

When first configuring LiveStreamPing using Sniff it is preferable to have a desired channel for setup and one or more channels for the live alerts themselves to be posted in. You are able to post live alerts to several channels in various different channels.

This would be done at first using:

`~add <channelname>`

`~msg <messagehere>`

`~channel <#config-channel>`

`~ac <channelname> <#live-alerts>`

This process can be replicated several times or you may choose to differentiate the channel posted to.
The message set will be universal across all live alerts on your server.
