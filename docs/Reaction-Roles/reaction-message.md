# Reaction message

Usage: `~rrmsg (#channel) <message>`

:::info Info

This command is the first command that must be ran when setting up reaction roles and will set a message that the reaction roles will link to.

Example(without channel without channel argument):

![Reaction role msg](/img/rrmsg.png)
